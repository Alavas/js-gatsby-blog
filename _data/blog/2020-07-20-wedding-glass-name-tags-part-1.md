title: Wedding Glass Name Tags Part 1

For my upcoming wedding in October I wanted to create a small favor that captured a bit of my personality. What I ended up coming up with is a little name tag to put on your glass with your name on it so that you don't lose track of it. To make that more fun the tag itself is made from a 1mm FR4 PCB with the name then engraved on one side using a small CNC mill.

I started off the design with a quick sketch in a notebook that I quickly moved over to Fusion360. Once in Fusion I created a few 3D printed versions to get the dimensions how I wanted them. Once I had the dimensions worked out the fun part was moving the drawing into KiCad. I got the idea to make the tag from a PCB after watching videos from Mike from mikeselectricstuff on YouTube. Mike has some amazing videos and has been an enormous inspiration to me.
